        <p>KFC first entered the South African market in 1971. The company was forced to divest its 60 company owned outlets and trademarks to a South African holding company called Devco in 1987 after the US Congress passed a law forbidding American companies from owning South African assets. <br>
            The company's 120 franchised outlets were not affected. KFC continued to collect an administrative fee from Devco. The company reacquired its former assets when sanctions were lifted in 1994.<br>
            By 1994 there were around 300 KFC outlets in the country.<br>
            As of 2021, there are 960 KFC outlets in South Africa, and the fast food chain has more outlets in the country than any other fast food brand.<br>
            Ten percent of outlets are company owned, and 90 percent are franchise owned.<br>
            Outlets sell the regional pap dish as well as other dishes unique to their menu in South Africa.<br>
South Africa is one of the few countries where KFC does not sell PepsiCo owned soft drinks, due to the company's historically small presence in the country.<br>
All of the chicken sold is reared in South Africa.
